                <p class="para2">Completing my second year of college pursuing BTech in Electronics & Communication  has been exhilarating. During my third and fourth semesters, I delved into learning Python programming language and web development, which provided a captivating initiation into the coding realm. The daily discoveries driven by logic and the necessity for patience have continually amazed me. As I transition from my sophomore to my junior year, I eagerly anticipate exploring advanced concepts and honing my skills further. The journey ahead promises exciting opportunities to deepen my understanding and proficiency in coding.

                            I have strong CSS skills, focusing on styling to enhance the presentation of a project. I
                            know how to effectively apply styles to various tags to make the design more appealing. My
                            expertise includes optimizing elements such as fonts, colors, margins, and layout properties

                            I’m skilled in JavaScript, capable of integrating scripts into HTML to control webpage
                            interactions. I understand how to make a page respond to actions like button clicks and am
                            familiar with concepts such as DOM manipulation and API calls. This enables me to create
                            dynamic and interactive web experiences.

                            projects, such as building a Tic-Tac-Toe game. My experience includes leveraging templates
                            for generic programming and using classes and friend functions to structure and manage code
                            effectively.

                            `useEffect` for handling side effects. This knowledge helps in building more efficient and
                            maintainable user interfaces. </p>
